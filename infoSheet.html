    <p>
        This study is investigating audio algorithms designed to improve how individuals localise where a sound comes
        from
        when using binaural technology.

        We are inviting participants who are: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            normal hearing
        </li>
        <li>
            18 years or older
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p> to participate in this study. You may terminate your participation at any time. </p>

    <h2>What tasks will I be asked to complete?</h2>
    <p>

        This App has five parts that you will be guided through. These are:
    <ul>
        <li>Infomation Sheet - Reading and indicating if you agree or disagree to participate.</li>
        <li>Experiment Settings - Generating a unique ID and setting your headphones to a comfortable level.</li>
        <li>Calibration - Complete a short process to generate a unique audio algorithm.</li>
        <li>Training - to introduce different parts of the interface. </li>
        <li>Listening Test - The full listening test, this involves short noise bursts and identifying on a diagram
            the direction you perceived them as coming from. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>After completing the listening test you will need to upload the results.</p>
    <h2>Are there any risks involved?</h2>
    <p>
        Participation in this study is low risk, with noise exposure and fatigue the only possible risks. To mitigate
        the risk
        of noise exposure, the app will guide you through the process setting the audio level to a safe volume before being allowed to continue.</p>
    <p>
        To minimise the risk of fatigue, the app will prompt you to take a break part way through. 
        <b>
            You are reminded your
            participation in this experiment is voluntary and you may pause the experiment to take a rest or stop the experiment
            entirely at any time.
        </b>

    By completing the tasks in this app you will be contributing to research at the University of York. This means that
    you

   <p>
    Anonymous responses to the survey and experimental task will be stored in line with the University policy. They may be used (either
    individually or aggregated across participants) in internal or external research publications and/or to inform the
    design and implementation of new audio technology with our commercial partners.
